# Recording-Budget
Introduction : This system makes household accounting easier using a mobile device (Android).


## Development Environment
1. Development Framework : Android Studio, visual studio code(Back end Rest API)
2. Database : MySQL(phpMyadmin)


## Folder Structure
1. buget : This folder contains mobile applications developed using Java.
2. Database connect API : This folder includes a REST API for posting, getting, putting, and deleting data in the database as requested by the mobile applications.


## System setting
To operate this system, you need to update the API paths in the request classes located at C:\budget\app\src\main\java\com\mok\budget to the URL of the server where the REST API has been uploaded.

## Program Description
I have included a PowerPoint presentation that provides an overview of the "Recording-Budget" program. Please refer to the `Program_Description.pptx` file for detailed information about the system.
